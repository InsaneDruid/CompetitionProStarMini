# CompetitionProStarMini
A replacement PCB for the Competition Pro Mini and Pro Star Mini (with autofire) Joysticks to easily replace failing microswitches with modern parts.

The Saia-Burgess F4T7-UL Microswitches used in this design provide up to 10 000 000 cycles of operation and allow the original stick gate to remain in place, giving the best overall experience.

A bent piece of copper wire can be used to further secure the directional switches to the pcb, using the provided mounting holes.
